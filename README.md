Use this file to help expite the grading process of Python Labs in Zybooks.  I used this while I was an instructor at SHNU.  ZyBooks will typically tell you if the labs are correct/incorrect and the only real thing need is if comments were used.  This pulls out the comments automatically.

Step One: Pick a lab assignment
Step Two: Download ALL Submissions
Step Three: Run this tool
Step Four: Select the .zip file downloaded from ZyBooks

The code will output in termainal and you can see each students name and what comments they added to their code.


Enjoy the tool.  Feel free to make it better!
